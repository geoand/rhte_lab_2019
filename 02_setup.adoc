= Accessing to the Lab Environment

== Getting your dedicated lab environments using Guid Grabber

On your laptop, you **MUST** open a browser tab pointing to the following link:https://www.opentlc.com/gg/gg.cgi?profile=generic_tester[*Open TLC Page*] before to continue with the lab instructions:

* From this page, you will be assigned your unique GUID, which you will use to access your unique ocp cluster environment and system.

> **NOTE: You are not required to login anywhere at this point, in this intro lab you will only get the information related to your assigned lab environments.**

=== Getting Cluster Environment - **Browser Tab**

This will be your lab environment where all of the work will be done. 

From the drop down list:

1. Choose the lab `A2026 - Simplifying the deployment of your Spring Boot application using our Dev Exp Operator on Kubenetes`
2. Enter the activation key shared by the instructors: `component`
3. Enter the email address:
4. Click submit
5. Save the information on screen

e.g:

image::images/request-env-gg.png[Request Env GuidGrabber]

The resulting *Lab Information page* will display your lab's `GUID` and other useful information about your lab environment.
Take note of your assigned `GUID`.

You will use this `GUID` to access your lab's environment and systems.
Your unique `GUID` will also be embedded in your lab environment's host name.

=== Lab information page

On the *Lab Information page* displayed by https://opentlc.com/gg/gg.cgi?profile=generic-tester` you will get different information such as :

. URL of the OpenShift Console
. URL of the API to access to Openshift using the `oc` client tool
. Hostname of the VM to ssh

e.g : Lab Information - image:images/lab.png[Lab Information]

=== Login to OpenShift Console

Click on the *OpenShift Master Console* link within the page to open the console within your browser.
This is the web console that we want to login and use for most of the lab instructions. The username and password to access the console will be there below the URLs as well.

1. Click on the URL and open the link in another tab.
2. Use the credentials to login to the console on login screen.
