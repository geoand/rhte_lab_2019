= Red Hat Tech Exchange 2019: CND-RUN

*Session Title:*  Simplify ...

*Description:*
The Emergency Response demo shows the power of the integrated Red Hat middleware portfolio running on OpenShift.  In this technical lab, you will obtain hands-on with this demo and modernize it by migrating an existing Spring Boot service to Quarkus so as to dramatically reduce its runtime footprint and start-up time.  The Emergency Response demo is inspired by the Cajun Navy activities during Hurricane Harvey where the barriers to volunteer community action were dramatically reduced during this crisis.
