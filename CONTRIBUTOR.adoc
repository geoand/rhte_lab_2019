To test the workshop/playbook against an existing OCP Cluster which has been created for this lab, run the following command
to git clone the `agnosticd` project and next start the `it.sh` script

**Remark**

Review with the RHTE team, what should be the values to be used for the following parameters:

- OCP_CONSOLE:  console-openshift-console.apps.shared-dev.dev.openshift.opentlc.com
- OCP_API:      https://api.shared-dev.dev.openshift.opentlc.com:6443
- TARGET_HOST:  bastion.dev.openshift.opentlc.com
- OCP_USERNAME: ec2-user

Open a terminal and execute the following commands to clone the agnosticd project and
next to apply the workshop playbook
```
git clone https://github.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd && cd agnosticd
git checkout development
cd ..
./it.sh agnosticd/ansible/roles
```

You can ssh to the vm's cluster using the information shared by the RHTE team if your ssh public key has been shared and imported
within the VM
```
e.g using the user ec2-user which has sudo password
ssh ec2-user@bastion.dev.openshift.opentlc.com
```
